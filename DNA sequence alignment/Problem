Problem: DNA Sequence AlignmentProblem DescriptionIn bioinformatics, comparing DNA sequences is a common task. 
The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for sequence alignment. 
Given two DNA sequences, the algorithm finds the best alignment considering matches, mismatches, and gaps.
Create a Java program that aligns two DNA sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. 
The program should allow the user to:Input two DNA sequences.Specify the scoring system (match score, mismatch penalty, and gap penalty).
Output the optimal alignment and the alignment score.
Example Input and OutputWelcome to the DNA Sequence Alignment Tool!

Enter the first DNA sequence: AGCTG
Enter the second DNA sequence: AGTTG
Enter match score: 1
Enter mismatch penalty: -1
Enter gap penalty: -2

Optimal alignment:
AGCTG
AG-TG

Alignment score: 2
